## Garden-Grower // Bunny Battleship

This was an opportunity to challenge and learn the intricacies of creating a full-stack game.

The bunny-battleship I have created is based on the classic Battleship game and uses sockets to emit messages.

This SPA is meant to be a fun and friendly, i.e. kid-friendly, rendition.

## Technologies Used

This SPApp was created with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, React and ultimately deployed on Heroku.

## Getting Started

The app is hosted on Heroku and is acccessible through this [Garden Grower](https://garden-grower.herokuapp.com/) link. 

The object of the game is to blow up the other other player's ships, but in our case it is to snack on all the veggies our lil' bunnies can grab ahold of.

## Next Steps

* UI Placement rather than randomization.

* Jumpy CSS, with the focus being on building out logic, some CSS items look imperfect.

* Having a game message to say whose turn it is, along with whether or not the cell was eaten/snacked on by the bunny.

* Create a more responsive design and a better flow.
